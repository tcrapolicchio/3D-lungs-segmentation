This project focuses on accurate 3D lung segmentation from CT scans, crucial for clinical evaluation and volumetric analysis. Using axial and coronal slices from a single patient's CT dataset, the pipeline isolates lung structures and estimates their volumes. Robustness is tested under various noise conditions to assess performance reliability.
